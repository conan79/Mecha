* Think of a way to handle "actions"
* Limit range of actions, such as Move and Fire
* Instantiate green translucent cubes over all tiles which are within reach of an action
* Make each mech only able to perform 1 action per turn, and a way to go to "next player"
* Make difficult terrain different from normal terrain (i.e, implement difficult terrain)
