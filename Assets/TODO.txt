* Create a "WorldInputManager" or something similar
	* This one should hold the "OnTileClicked" event, and also check if a tile has been clicked, etc.

* Do not create move action view for current tile
	* For this, I need to check whether or not tiles have a mech on them when finding walkable tiles
		* For this I need to make tiles keep track whether or not they have a mech on them

* Finish the actual move action action
	* Make it so each move action tile waits to be clicked
		* This can be done by letting world invoke "OnTileClicked"

* Make each mech only able to perform 1 action per turn, and a way to go to "next player"
	
* Write a method to calculate and return the tiles which are eligble to be fired upon
