* Bug: If an attack action is canceled, the mech is selected but without having an active move action. Perhaps (for now) have a heap of actions that override eachother?

* Rework the UI flow
	* When a mech is hovered, it should be outlined
	* When a mechs weapon is clicked, it should leave the move state and enter an attack state, showing what tiles it can fire at

* Implement "shooting" 
	* Implement AttackCommand

* Create menus
	* Create debug main menu. Just a menu displaying the buttons "Host" or "Join"
	* Create debug lobby, where people design their mechs. When everyone is ready, the game starts

* Add all the mech components from the design doc to the databases

* Create a way to design own mechs ingame in the lobby phase

* The action system should probably be a finite state machine...
