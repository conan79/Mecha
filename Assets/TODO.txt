* Create a turn system
	* Implement invokation of "OnNewMyTurn" 
		* For this, there has to be several "Player" objects which keep track of what player is local. Photon Time?

* Create a "Program.cs" which is the single MB. Clean up World.cs with this.

* Add a "Next Turn" UI button in the bottom right

* Add health bars above active mechs

* Add debug UI showing the stats of active mechs
	
* Add a way of "shooting" at something. For now, right click a mech to go into "shoot mode" and then left click within range to shoot.

* The pathfinding is a crime against humanity. "CanEnter" is entered 160k times whenever a MoveAction begins for some reason. Send help and more diet coke.
