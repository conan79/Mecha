* Do not create move action view for current tile

* Finish the actual move action action
	* Make it so each move action tile waits to be clicked
		* This can be done by letting world invoke "OnTileClicked"

* Make each mech only able to perform 1 action per turn, and a way to go to "next player"
	
* Write a method to calculate and return the tiles which are eligble to be fired upon
