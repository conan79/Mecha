* Rework how mechs are controlled 
	* When a mech is clicked, it should be marked as "active" or "selected". 
		* Selected mechs should show a window displaying its health, stats and a "Move" or "Attack" option

* Implement "shooting" 

* Create menus
	* Create debug main menu. Just a menu displaying the buttons "Host" or "Join"
	* Create debug lobby, where people design their mechs. When everyone is ready, the game starts

* Add all the mech components from the design doc to the databases

* Create a way to design own mechs ingame in the lobby phase
