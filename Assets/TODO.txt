* Rework the UI flow
	* When a mech is hovered, it should be outlined
	* When a mech is hovered, it should show all the tiles it could move to in a light green color
		* Gotta add a "OnTileHovered" callback for InputManager, and "OnMechHovered" for MechInputManager
	* When a mech is clicked, it should show all the tiles it could move to in a green color, and it should show the path it would take to any walkable tile the mouse hovers over
	* When a mechs weapon is clicked, it should leave the move state and enter an attack state, showing what tiles it can fire at
	* Replace the ugly Unity default sprites with square, nice sprites

* Implement "shooting" 
	* Implement a way to pick a weapon to use for the attack
	* Implement AttackCommand

* Create menus
	* Create debug main menu. Just a menu displaying the buttons "Host" or "Join"
	* Create debug lobby, where people design their mechs. When everyone is ready, the game starts

* Add all the mech components from the design doc to the databases

* Create a way to design own mechs ingame in the lobby phase
